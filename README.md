_"Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs every time."_ -- Ed Felten and Gary McGraw

This is an Android app that steals all the names of apps installed on device and sends them to a web server.  I developed this app in summer 2014 to validate Ed and Gary's famous quote.
